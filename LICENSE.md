## Terms and Conditions

### General

These terms and conditions apply to the project "Transport", especially the open source repositories on Github.

The terms of use of this software are as follows:

### Disclaimer of Warranty.
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. The project is open source on the Github platform, so everyone has the possibility to suggest changes. Every effort is made to prevent any risk as far as possible in terms of quality and safety. This risk should be further reduced by the mutual monitoring of the code on the platform. We assume no liability for damages caused by third party software (such as the Chromium Embedded Framework) or if the cause of the damage does not lie in the source code or the developers of the program, but through their own fault, such as computer viruses or malicious programs that exploit the security holes of the above software. Furthermore, we do not assume any liability for the program itself, since you can also view the source code of the program and have it checked for security if necessary. You assume all necessary maintenance, repairs or corrections in the event of damage resulting from this.

### Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT, unless required by law or agreed in writing, no copyright holder or other person who has modified the program as permitted above shall be liable for any damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages, arising out of the use of the program (including but not limited to loss of data or incorrect interoperability with other programs), even if the holder or the party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
