# Reporting Issues

Have you found a reproducible problem in transport? Or do you have a wish for a new feature? We'd love to hear about it! Here we show you how to make reporting issues as effective as possible.

### Identify Where to Report

The Transport project is distributed across several repositories. For example, the desktop app and mobile app are located in two different locations.
Try to create the issue in the correct repository.

Can you also reproduce the issue if possible themes or extensions are disabled? If the problem was caused by one of them, please file it in the corresponding repo.

### Look For an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, check for existing open issues to see if the problem has already been addressed here.

If this is the case, try to create useful comments or add a reaction to matching comments. Examples of this are:

* 👍 - upvote
* 👎 - downvote

If you cannot find a suitable issue for your problem or topic, you can create a new issue according to the scheme below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Submit one issue per problem or feature request. Do not try to use an issue for multiple problems or feature requests.

Do not add an issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it has the same problem, but also for the same reason. Many issues look similar but have other causes.

The more information you provide, the more likely it is that someone will succeed in reproducing this bug and finding a fix.

Please add the following to your issue:

* Version of Transport

* List of extensions or themes you have installed.

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) which cause the error

* What you would have expected vs. what you see right now

* Images, animations or a link to a video illustrating the problem.

* Error in error log (located in logs folder)

### Final Checklist

Please remember to do the following:

* [ ] Search the issue repository to ensure your report is a new issue

* [ ] Recreate the issue after disabling all extensions or themes

* [ ] Simplify your situation around the issue to better isolate the problem

Don't feel bad if the developers can't reproduce the issue at the first time. They will simply ask for more information!

### Follow Your Issue

Once submitted, your report will go into the issue tracking work flow. Be sure to understand what will happen next, so you know what to expect, and how to continue to assist throughout the process.
